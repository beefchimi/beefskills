# Agent instructions for Beef Skills

This repo is a **personal skills library** for Claude. When working here, prefer using and following the skills under `.claude/skills/`.

## Skills available

- **react-dev** — React and TypeScript performance and best practices. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/TypeScript code (components, data fetching, bundle size, performance).
- **skill-creator** — Use when creating, updating, or authoring a new skill, or when asked about skill structure, best practices, or SKILL.md format.

## How to use them

- **Read the skill** when the task matches the description above (e.g. React/TS work → read `react-dev`; creating skills → read `skill-creator`).
- **Apply the skill’s instructions** before answering or making changes; don’t skip steps or assume the content.
- When maintaining this repo (adding/editing skills), use the **skill-creator** skill so structure and descriptions stay consistent.
